# Nyw (nywida)

A declarative package manager helper. Define your entire system package configuration in a single JSON file and let nyw handle the rest.

## What is nyw?

Nyw allows you to declaratively manage packages across different operating systems and package managers using a simple JSONC configuration file. Instead of manually installing packages one by one, you describe your desired system state and nyw makes it happen.

Most developers are familiar with the declarative approach to managing projectsâ€”using tools like Cargo.toml or package.json. So why not apply the same principle to your operating system configuration? This way, you can reliably rebuild your system exactly the way you want it, every time.

## Features

### Fully Supported Package Managers
- **dnf/yum** (Fedora/RHEL)
- **brew** (macOS/Linux)
- **pacman** (Arch Linux)
- **apk** (Alpine Linux)
- **apt** (Debian/Ubuntu)
- **paru** (AUR helper)
- **yay** (AUR helper)

### Experimental Support
- **winget** (Windows) - Currently in testing phase and is not fully implemented

### Planned Support
- **Android Package Manager** via ADB - Planned



## Getting Started

1. Create your configuration file based on the provided `example.jsonc`
2. Run nyw to apply your configuration
3. Your system will be configured exactly as described

## Configuration

Nyw uses a JSONC (JSON with Comments) configuration file where you can define all your packages. Check out `example.jsonc` in this repository for a complete example of how to structure your configuration.

The configuration file allows you to:
- Specify packages for different package managers
- Set up package repositories
- Define system-specific configurations
- Comment your configuration for better maintainability

## Installation

```bash
# AUR
paru -S nyw

# Linux/MacOS
already supported but no install instructions
```

## Usage

```bash
# Apply your configuration
nyw
```

## Why nyw?

Born from the frustration of manually managing packages across different systems, nyw brings the declarative package management philosophy of NixOS to any Linux distribution (and beyond). Whether you're managing a single machine or an entire fleet, nyw ensures consistency and reproducibility in terms of packages and system configurations.

However, unlike tools that generate lock files (like `package-lock.json` or `Cargo.lock`), nyw does not track exact versions or preserve access to older package versions.

## Support

Nyw will always remain free and open source. If you find it useful and want to support its continued development, crypto donations are greatly appreciated.
